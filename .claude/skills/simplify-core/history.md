# Simplify-core history

The skill's memory. Read it first on every run; the retrospective (step 7) updates it. Newest run last.

## Lens rotation

Least recently run goes next. A lens with no accepted proposal in its last three runs is retired (it can be revived with a reason).

## Next-major list

Approved breaking simplifications, each with its deprecation already shipped. They land together in one major with one migration guide.

_(empty)_

Candidates waiting on a deprecation (P2026-10-07-6): the four autoclose `ActOptions` fields with no reader, and their three `DEFAULT_*` exports.

## Mutation baselines

The last trusted Stryker scores, recorded when the setup was removed (#1805) because it can't run on vitest 5. A revived setup compares against these.

| package | score | old break floor |
|---|---|---|
| act | 85.7% | 80 |
| act-pg | 94.4% | 88 |
| act-sqlite | 93.0% | 87 |
| act-http | 92.4% | 86 |
| act-crypto | 92.9% | 87 |
| act-ops | 98.4% | 92 |
| act-patch | 79.1% | 73 |
| act-tck | 39.7% | 34 |

## Backlog

Sound proposals that missed a run's cut. The next run ranks these before looking for new ones.

- Trim rationale from public type JSDoc in `types/ports.ts`, `types/action.ts`, `types/reaction.ts` (~450 lines); the reasoning belongs in docs/docs.
- Move the close lock and catch-up out of `act.ts` into one close module (act.ts is 2,369 lines).
- Fold the duplicated Postgres fault-injection cases into `store.error.spec.ts`.
- Move adapter tests that repeat a contract (priority, Date revival, stream patterns, notify, `query_stats` paging) into the TCK, and fix the stale Date-revival claim in behavior-contracts row 149.
- One home for blocked-stream recovery in the docs; trim the CLAUDE.md bullets that repeat it; fix 3 stale doc paths.
- Remove the `KafkaBroker` placeholder from act-notify (it only throws; public, needs a deprecation).

## Self-changes

Every change the retrospective made to `SKILL.md`, `lenses.md` or `metrics.sh`, with the evidence that prompted it.

- 2026-10-07: the bar said `IAct` and `Act` should expose the same methods. `IAct` is deliberately the narrow surface reaction handlers receive; matching them would grow the handler surface. Reworded: `IAct` stays small, extra `Act` methods are documented as operator surface. (Evidence: surface specialist, `types/action.ts` IAct doc.)
- 2026-10-07: added the backlog. Four specialists returned 20 proposals and the 5–7 cap dropped sound ones; without a backlog the next run would rediscover them.
- 2026-10-07: a behavior claim ranks only after the main loop reproduces it with an asserting test and a control. The specialist's `start_correlations` probe only logged; it turned out right, but an unasserted probe is not evidence.
- 2026-10-07: mutation lens marked blocked. `mutation.yml` documents that Stryker's vitest runner can't match vitest 5 test names, so every mutant survives and the run is meaningless.

## Runs

### 2026-10-07 — baseline (no lenses)

| metric | value |
|---|---|
| core lines (libs/act/src) | 21389 |
| code lines / comment lines | 10221 / 11168 (52% comments) |
| ticket refs in source | 404 |
| files over 300 lines | 21 |
| runtime exports (@rotorsoft/act) | 54 |
| IAct methods / Act class public methods | 8 / 20 |
| Store port methods | 18 |
| ActOptions fields | 14 |
| spec files / test lines (all libs: 45523 src lines) | 241 / 60936 |
| test names citing tickets | 200 |
| published packages (libs/) | 12 |
| CI workflows / lines | 8 / 1132 |
| docs lines (excl. generated API) / CLAUDE.md lines | 9552 / 333 |

Largest files:
- libs/act/src/act.ts (2369)
- libs/act/src/types/ports.ts (1476)
- libs/act/src/adapters/in-memory-store.ts (1434)
- libs/act/src/types/action.ts (1228)
- libs/act/src/internal/correlate-cycle.ts (961)
- libs/act/src/builders/state-builder.ts (919)
- libs/act/src/internal/event-sourcing.ts (899)

Context: the framework is published, and many recent changes were bug fixes that each added mechanism; the user notes some of them overcomplicated things (e.g. #1795, closed unmerged in favor of a doc fix). Notable starting points: 52% of core lines are comments; 404 ticket references in source and 200 in test names; 21 core files over 300 lines; `IAct` declares 8 methods while the `Act` class exposes 20; tests (61k lines) outweigh library source (45k); 104 core spec files, many named per ticket (seven `correlate-*` specs).

Proposals: none (baseline). Decisions pending: none.

### 2026-10-07 — first full run (four specialists)

| metric | baseline | now | why |
|---|---|---|---|
| core lines | 21389 | 21396 | +7 from #1796/#1798 (wave-27 fixes) |
| comment lines | 11168 | 11175 (52%) | same PRs; comments citing tickets |
| ticket refs in source | 404 | 407 | same PRs: my fixes still add ticket numbers to comments |
| test lines | 60936 | 60995 | regression tests for the wave-27 fixes (earned) |
| test names citing tickets | 200 | 202 | same; should have been named by behavior |
| everything else | | unchanged | |

Audit: since the baseline, 13 fix PRs merged, all mine. Two were fix-on-fix in the same area and were cut back (#1795 closed for the doc fix #1801; #1760 replaced by #1769). The habit to stop: ticket numbers in new comments and test names.

Lenses: Public surface, Dead code, Hotspots, File budget, Comment noise, Concepts and options, DRY, Tests by concept, Packages, Infra, One source of truth. Mutation: blocked.

Proposals (decisions due next run):
- P2026-10-07-1. Make `start_correlations` drain what it finds (bug: polling marks remote work but never runs reactions; reproduced with a control) by turning it into a timer around `settle()`, and delete the separate polling path.
- P2026-10-07-2. Delete the dead Stryker setup (18 files, ~690 lines).
- P2026-10-07-3. Strip ticket numbers and history from internal comments (~330 refs, ~1,500 lines).
- P2026-10-07-4. Tests by concept: merge the six `correlate-*` specs, delete tests of dead private fields, fix the correlator flake, rename 246 ticket-named tests.
- P2026-10-07-5. CI and repo cleanup: fix the docs deploy filter (misses 6 packages), build docs once, delete `npm_migration.md`, the stale root CHANGELOG and 4 copied tsup configs.
- P2026-10-07-6. Deprecate 16 unused public exports and `Act.stop_settling`; knip cleanup of internal dead code; queue the dead autoclose options for the next major.
- P2026-10-07-7. Rewrite `InMemoryStore.query` as one loop (complexity 65 → ~15); move drain defaults into `internal/config.ts`.
