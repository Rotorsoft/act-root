/**
 * @category Orchestrator
 * @see Store
 *
 * Main orchestrator for event-sourced state machines and workflows.
 *
 * It manages the lifecycle of actions, reactions, and event streams, providing APIs for loading state, executing actions, querying events, and draining reactions.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * const app = new Act(registry, 100);
 * await app.do("increment", { stream: "counter1", actor }, { by: 1 });
 * const snapshot = await app.load(Counter, "counter1");
 * await app.drain();
 * ```
 *
 * - Register event listeners with `.on("committed", ...)` and `.on("acked", ...)` to react to lifecycle events.
 * - Use `.query()` to analyze event streams for analytics or debugging.
 *
 * @template TSchemaReg SchemaRegister for state
 * @template TEvents Schemas for events
 * @template TActions Schemas for actions
 * @template TStateMap Map of state names to state schemas
 * @template TActor Actor type extending base Actor

   * Discovers and registers new streams dynamically based on reaction resolvers.
   *
   * Correlation enables "dynamic reactions" where target streams are determined at runtime
   * based on event content. For example, you might create a stats stream for each user
   * when they perform certain actions.
   *
   * This method scans events matching the query and identifies new target streams based
   * on reaction resolvers. It then registers these streams so they'll be picked up by
   * the next drain cycle.

   *   `{ after: <event-id>, limit: <count> }`)
   * @returns Object with newly leased streams and last scanned event ID

   * @example Manual correlation
   * ```typescript
   * // Scan for new streams
   * const { leased, last_id } = await app.correlate({ after: 0, limit: 100 });

   *
