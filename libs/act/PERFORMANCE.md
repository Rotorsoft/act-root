# Performance History

This document tracks the evolution of Act's performance optimizations with benchmark data. For current patterns and strategies, see the [README](libs/act/README.md).

All PostgreSQL benchmarks run against a local instance on port 5431. Each benchmark uses `vitest bench` with default iterations. Numbers vary between runs — focus on relative improvements, not absolute values.

## Cache Port (v0.20.0)

**PR:** #460 — Introduced always-on `InMemoryCache` (LRU, maxSize 1000) to eliminate full event replay on `load()`.

### Strategy

Cache stores the latest state checkpoint per stream. On `load()`, only events committed after the cached position are replayed. On `action()`, the cache is updated after every successful commit. Concurrency errors invalidate stale entries.

### Why cache on every commit, not just on snap?

An alternative design would update the cache only at snap boundaries. We benchmarked both:

**Cache on every commit** (chosen):

| Events | No snap | @10 | @50 | @75 | @100 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **50** | 4,872 | 5,881 | 6,480 | **7,058** | 6,949 |
| **500** | **6,371** | 5,639 | 5,590 | 6,223 | 5,488 |
| **2,000** | 4,257 | **5,329** | 4,573 | 4,812 | 4,039 |

**Cache only on snap** (rejected):

| Events | No snap | @10 | @50 | @75 | @100 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **50** | 608 | 5,845 | 6,098 | 694 | 1,006 |
| **500** | 212 | **6,481** | 4,955 | 570 | 5,074 |
| **2,000** | 101 | **6,827** | 5,993 | 675 | 4,039 |

The snap-only strategy fails for states without `.snap()` (falls back to full replay) and has cache misses between snap boundaries. Cache-on-commit costs one `Map.set()` per commit but guarantees every `load()` after the first action is a cache hit.

**Compared to pre-cache baselines** (PG, no cache):

| Events | Without cache | With cache | Speedup |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **50** | 655 | 4,872 | **7x** |
| **500** | 215 | 6,371 | **30x** |
| **2,000** | 92 | 4,257 | **46x** |

> **InMemoryStore note:** InMemory benchmarks cap at ~830 ops/s because every method starts with `await sleep(0)` to simulate async behavior. The event-loop yield costs ~1ms per call.

## Atomic Stream Claiming (v0.21.0)

**PR:** #471 — Replaced two-phase poll→lease drain cycle with atomic `claim()` using PostgreSQL's `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`.

### Strategy

The old drain cycle used two separate store calls: `poll()` to discover available streams, then `lease()` to lock them. Between these calls, another worker could grab the same stream — a race condition that wasted cycles.

`claim()` fuses both into a single SQL transaction using `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` — the PostgreSQL idiomatic competing consumer pattern. Workers never block each other; locked rows are silently skipped. This is the same pattern used by pgBoss, Graphile Worker, and Oban.

Also replaced `lease(leases, 0)` in `correlate()` with `subscribe()` — a clean upsert for registering reaction target streams.

### Multi-worker contention benchmark

Separate `Act` instances sharing the same PostgresStore connection pool, each with its own drain lock — simulating distributed workers competing for streams through the same database.

Each configuration seeds N streams with 5 events each, then runs W concurrent drain loops until all streams are processed. **Throughput** = total acked streams / wall-clock time. **Waste** = drain cycles that found no work (wasted DB round-trips).

| Config | poll→lease (streams/s) | claim (streams/s) | poll→lease waste | claim waste | Improvement |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| **1w × 100s** | 1,271 | 1,790 | 0% | 0% | **41% faster** |
| **1w × 500s** | 5,731 | 5,202 | 0% | 0% | ~same |
| **3w × 100s** | 1,081 | 892 | 11% | 13% | ~same |
| **3w × 500s** | 3,439 | 4,222 | 13% | 12% | **23% faster** |
| **5w × 100s** | 507 | 590 | 14% | 17% | **16% faster** |
| **5w × 500s** | 2,244 | 4,424 | 17% | 7% | **97% faster, waste halved** |

**Key findings:**

- The improvement scales with load — at **5 workers × 500 streams**, `claim` is **97% faster** and waste drops from 17% to 7%
- With the old poll→lease, workers would poll the same streams, then compete at the lease phase — many lose and waste the cycle
- With `claim` (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`), each worker atomically grabs different streams in one query — no wasted discoveries
- At low concurrency (1 worker), the improvement comes from eliminating one DB round-trip per drain cycle
- At high concurrency, the improvement compounds: fewer wasted cycles × fewer DB round-trips × zero contention blocking

### Interface simplification

The Store interface was also simplified:

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `poll(lagging, leading)` | *(removed)* |
| `lease(leases, millis)` | *(removed)* |
| — | `claim(lagging, leading, by, millis)` |
| — | `subscribe(streams)` |

Net reduction of 139 lines in the first commit, plus cleaner separation of concerns: `claim` for drain, `subscribe` for correlate, `ack`/`block` for finalization.
