_Test Compatibility Kit for the `Store`, `Cache`, and `Logger` ports of [@rotorsoft/act](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rotorsoft/act). Lane conformance suite (claim filter, subscribe UPSERT, ack/block round-trip) added in v0.4.0 ([ACT-1103](https://github.com/Rotorsoft/act-root/issues/733))._

## Why this package

A port without an executable contract is undefined behavior. Act has three pluggable ports (event store, snapshot cache, logger), each with multiple in-tree adapters and an open door for third-party implementations. Before this package, every adapter's test file independently re-stated what the contract was — tribal knowledge, not a spec.

`act-tck` turns the contract into a runnable spec. Drop it into your adapter's test file, point it at your implementation, and vitest will execute the same conformance suite the in-tree adapters pass. New port methods land here first; adapters add capability flags and opt in.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add -D @rotorsoft/act-tck
```

The kit is a dev dependency — it ships test code, not runtime code.

## Quick start

```ts
// libs/act-mysql/test/store-tck.spec.ts
import { runStoreTck } from "@rotorsoft/act-tck";
import { MysqlStore } from "../src/index.js";

runStoreTck({
  name: "MysqlStore",
  factory: () => new MysqlStore({ host: "localhost", database: "act_tck" }),
  capabilities: { notify: false },
});
```

That's the whole integration. `run*Tck` calls vitest's `describe`/`it` internally; your test runner drives execution. A fixed Counter-style fixture domain keeps tests deterministic and self-contained.

## API

- **`runStoreTck(options)`** — every `Store` method, capability-gated where optional.
- **`runCacheTck(options)`** — every `Cache` method, cross-stream isolation, dispose idempotency.
- **`runLoggerTck(options)`** — structural smoke test of the `Logger` contract.
- **`StoreCapabilities`** / **`CacheCapabilities`** / **`LoggerCapabilities`** — flag types for opting into optional surface (e.g., `Store.notify`).
- Fixture helpers re-exported from `@rotorsoft/act-tck/fixtures` for adapter-specific tests that want the same Counter domain.

## What's covered

### `runStoreTck`

Every method on the `Store` interface in [`libs/act/src/types/ports.ts`](https://github.com/Rotorsoft/act-root/blob/master/libs/act/src/types/ports.ts):

- `commit` — single + multi-event commits, optimistic concurrency, preserved state on rejection
- `query` — stream, names, correlation, before/after, created_after/before, limit, with_snaps, stream_exact, backward traversal
- `subscribe` — idempotent re-subscribe
- `claim` / `ack` — lease lifecycle, dual frontiers, leased streams not double-claimed, ack rejected from wrong holder
- `block` — blocked streams hidden from claim, same-drainer-only enforcement
- `reset` — restart watermarks (including blocked), no-op for missing
- `prioritize` — bulk priority updates by filter
- `truncate` — snapshot vs tombstone seeding, empty inputs, missing streams
- `query_streams` — filters, exact-match, pagination, blocked
- `query_stats` — array + filter forms, opt-in count/tail/names, exclude + before, snapshot count via `names`
- `notify` (capability-gated) — subscribe + dispose smoke test

### `runCacheTck`

Every method on the `Cache` interface: `get` on unset stream returns `undefined`; `set` then `get` round-trip; `set` overwrites; `invalidate` removes one stream, leaves others; `invalidate`/`clear` no-op on absent state; `clear` empties every stream; cross-stream isolation; `dispose` idempotency.

### `runLoggerTck`

Structural smoke test of the `Logger` interface: `level` is a non-empty string; every level method callable with both overload signatures; `null` and cyclic payloads don't throw; `child(bindings)` returns a Logger satisfying the same contract; `dispose` is idempotent and awaitable.

## Common patterns

### Capability flags for optional methods

Optional methods are gated so adapters can opt out of features they don't implement:

```ts
runStoreTck({
  name: "MysqlStore",
  factory: () => new MysqlStore({ /* … */ }),
  capabilities: { notify: true }, // adapter implements Store.notify
});
```

### Adding adapter-specific tests alongside the TCK

The TCK validates the contract; adapter-specific edge cases (defensive `rowCount ?? 0` branches, dialect-specific SQL paths) belong in the adapter's own test file. See `libs/act-pg/test/store.error.spec.ts` and `libs/act-sqlite/test/store.error.spec.ts` for the fault-injection patterns the in-tree adapters use to round out the 100% coverage gate.

### When the port interface changes

New / changed methods on `Store`, `Cache`, or `Logger` are added to `libs/act-tck/src/` in lockstep. Optional methods land behind a `Capabilities` flag so existing adapters keep passing until they opt in.

## Compatibility

- **Node**: >=22.18.0
- **Peer**: `@rotorsoft/act` (workspace version), `vitest` >=3.0.9, `zod` ^4.4.3
- **Runtime deps**: none — pure test code

## Stability

Public API governed by the [Act Stability Charter](../../STABILITY.md). The TCK's published surface — `runStoreTck`, `runCacheTck`, `runLoggerTck`, the `Capabilities` types, and the fixture helpers — is now covered by SemVer alongside the `Store`/`Cache`/`Logger` contracts it validates. Charter is **in effect as of 1.0.0**; the milestone tracker is [milestone 1.0](https://github.com/Rotorsoft/act-root/milestone/1).

The in-tree InMemoryStore / InMemoryCache / ConsoleLogger (bundled with `@rotorsoft/act`) are the first customers — they prove the TCK works before any external adapter ships.
