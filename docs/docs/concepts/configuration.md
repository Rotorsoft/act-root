This framework provides structured mechanisms for managing environment variables, configuration files, and logging settings. By centralizing configuration, you can ensure consistency, simplify deployment, and make it easier to manage changes across development, testing, and production environments.

## Environment Setup

Configure your application for different environments (development, production, testing) using environment variables and configuration files.

## Logging

Structured logging and debugging tools are provided to help you monitor and troubleshoot your application.
