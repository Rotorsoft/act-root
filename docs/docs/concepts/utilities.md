# Utilities

## Background
Utilities are supporting tools and helpers that streamline common tasks such as state patching, validation, and asynchronous operations. By providing robust, reusable utilities, the framework reduces boilerplate and helps developers focus on core business logic. These utilities are designed to be composable and type-safe, ensuring reliability and maintainability.

## State Patching

Immutably update state in response to events using provided utilities.

## Validation

Schema validation and error handling are built-in, leveraging Zod for type-safe schemas.

## Async Helpers

Utilities for working with asynchronous operations, such as delays and retries.
