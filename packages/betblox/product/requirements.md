# BetBlox â€” Requirements & Task List

## Functional Requirements

- [ ] Users can create prediction polls on blockchain (with wallet)
- [ ] Users can vote on open polls (with wallet, pay entry fee)
- [ ] Polls close at a set time; outcome is resolved (oracle/manual)
- [ ] Winnings are distributed to correct voters (minus 10% house fee)
- [ ] All actions are on-chain; backend listens to events and updates projections
- [ ] UI displays real-time poll data, voting, and results

## Technical Requirements

- [ ] **Blockchain smart contract** (Solana, Anchor, future chains)
- [ ] **Backend**: Node.js, event listener, Act projections, Drizzle ORM, trpc API
- [ ] **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon for beta)
- [ ] **Frontend**: Next.js, trpc, wallet adapter, elegant UI
- [ ] **Testing**: Unit, integration, contract, and e2e tests
- [ ] **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, deploy to Vercel (UI), Railway/Neon (backend/db)
- [ ] **Dev**: Local Solana validator, Anchor, Docker (optional)

- [ ] Add tests for projection logic (in progress).

### 4. Database (Postgres)

- [x] Set up local Postgres (Docker Compose for betblox).

### 5. Frontend (Next.js, trpc)

- [x] Scaffold Next.js app in `/src/ui`.
- [x] Install dependencies: trpc, Tailwind (for UI), etc.
- [x] Implement poll creation, voting, results, claim winnings.
- [x] Connect to backend via trpc.
- [x] Add elegant, responsive UI.
- [ ] Install wallet adapter and implement wallet connect (in progress).
- [x] Add modern navigation bar on all pages.
- [x] Add pagination to API endpoints and UI.
- [x] Handle nullable fields gracefully in UI.
- [x] Add reusable, modern-styled components.
- [ ] Add unit/component tests (Jest/React Testing Library) (in progress).
- [ ] Add e2e tests (Playwright/Cypress) (in progress).
- [x] Document frontend setup and local dev in README.

### 6. Dev Environment & Local Testing

- [x] Add dev script for UI.
- [x] Add `.env.example` for betblox.
- [x] Write scripts for:
  - Running backend and frontend in dev mode
  - Running migrations
- [ ] Write scripts for:
  - Starting local Solana validator (in progress)
  - Deploying contract locally (in progress)
  - Running all tests (in progress)
- [ ] Add Makefile or npm scripts for common tasks (in progress).

### 7. CI/CD

- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions workflow (in progress):
  - Lint, typecheck, test all packages

## Improvements & New Features from Refactor

- [x] **All event schemas consolidated** in a single file.
- [x] **Legacy endpoints and code paths removed** for poll creation/voting.
- [x] **Backend router refactored** as a "mocked blockchain" and commits events directly to the Act store.
- [x] **UI blockchain abstraction** (`blockchainClient`) created for all blockchain actions, with path aliasing.
- [x] **AI-powered poll suggestion** in poll creation UI.
- [x] **User can set poll close time** in the UI.
- [x] **Support for all event types** (PollCreated, VoteCast, PollClosed, WinningsClaimed) in both backend and UI abstraction.
- [x] **TypeScript project references and path aliases** set up for monorepo compatibility.
- [x] **UI and backend ready for easy swap to real blockchain integration**.
- [x] **All code paths and imports updated** to match the new architecture.
